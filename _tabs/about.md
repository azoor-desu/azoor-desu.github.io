## Hi there
I'm a guy that likes to make things.  

### Work
I started out making games using Unity Engine.  
I then specialized as a game programmer.  
I then moved on to creating game engines and developing backend systems for these game engines. 
Here's a link to the projects I did, mainly consisting of school projects: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link _tabs/portfolio.md %}  

I like creating optimized and fast systems. Hence I prefer working on backend systems of game engines I have worked on.  

### Hobbies
I like memes.  
{% include webm.html filepath="/assets/img/memes/happy-cat.webm" %}

I like games. Pew pew games are my favourite because i can turn off my brain.

Thank you and goodbye.
