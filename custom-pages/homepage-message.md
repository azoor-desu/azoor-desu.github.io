# Welcome to my blog.


Over here, you will find a bunch of stuff that I feel like typing down here and there. I may expand the usage of this site as time goes on, but for now, I'm still deciding what to type. I don't know why you're here but yeah.


The current plan will be to put my projects and stuff here, and keep it updated. Sort of like a portfolio. Also, I'll have some blog-style posts about random things related to tech or games or life or something.
