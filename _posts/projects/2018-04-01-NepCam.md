## **Project Description**
Do you want to take a picture with an anime girl? Well... yeah. The app allows scanning of labels and spawning a model in 3D space, allowing you to make it look like it's running around on the ground and stuff. You can also take pictures with it in photo booth mode without requiring any labels.  

The tech and development that went into this application was great, but the implementation was a mistake. :\|
