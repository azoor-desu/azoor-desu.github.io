## **Project Description**
Start from a cannon that launches your ball out! After launching, switch between the 3 ball types: Heavy, Normal and Bouncy to navigate through all the levels successfully.  
Heavy balls accelerate faster when falling or rolling, but bounce less.  
Normal ball gets blown by fans much more.  
Bouncy ball bounces the highest.  
Avoid the spike traps, get blown about by fans, and make use of gravity-flipping devices to reach the end goal in each level. Be warned, if your ball gets stuck, you'll have to restart the level!  

It's ~~morbing~~ morphing time!
