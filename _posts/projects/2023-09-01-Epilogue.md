## **Project Description**
3D first-person game that allows the player to play as a Thief, with abilities such as Time Manipulation.  
The game is built using a custom made real-time 3D engine.  
Takeoff Engine is written using C++, with gameplay scripts written in C#.  

## **Roles and Responsibilities**
Tech Lead | Engine Programmer | Game Programmer  
- Setup project structure, documentation, code architecture and feature requirements for Engine, with focus on proper organization of the codebase and files
- Implemented the Entity-Component System (ECS) from scratch, dictating the architecture of how components are added/removed/used by game objects and how they should be written.
- Implemented C# game scripting into C++ game engine using Mono, with hot reload for faster development iteration.
- Implemented timing system with fixed delta time for physics system use
- Implemented prefab system, similar to Unity
- Implemented in-game UI system
- Implemented scene management (loading/unloading of levels)
- Implemented serialization using YAML and RTTI (real time type introspection)
- Implemented integration of Game Editor's Inspector window with Engine to allow it to display an object's properties with RTTI
- Assisted in creating Game Editor by authoring the base architecture to work with the Game Engine
- Assisted with various Game Editor features and bug fixes
- Assisted with various bugs such as a crash in the Physics system due to a multi threaded issue
- Assisted with the animation system
- Assisted in creating misc gameplay scripts like camera panning for cutscenes, puzzles and doors etc.
